# LLM Suite

LLM Suite allows you compare responses of various local LLMs.

## Features

- Automatically detects installed Ollama models
- Customize temperature and system prompt
- View responses side-by-side or stacked
- Export results as CSV or JSON
- Download and remove models directly from the interface
- Save and load parameter profiles for quick configurations
- Stream responses in real-time to see generation as it happens
- Evaluate responses using another model to identify patterns
- Remove thinking blocks from model outputs
- Set default profiles for automatic loading on startup
- Debug information for troubleshooting model interactions

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- Python 3.7+
- Ollama installed and running locally

## Installation

1. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make sure you have Ollama installed and running:
   - Visit [Ollama's website](https://ollama.com/) to download and install if needed
   - Run the Ollama app

3. Pull some models (if you haven't already):

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama pull mistral
# And any other models you want to compare
```

### Running the App

1. Run the following in a terminal of your choice:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. The app should open in your browser (if not, navigate to the Local URL shown in the terminal)

## Usage Tips

- Click "Refresh Available Models" in the sidebar if you pull new models while the app is running
- Adjust the temperature slider to control randomness in responses
- Use the system prompt to set the context or personality for the models
- Switch between "Side by Side" and "Stacked" tabs to view responses in different layouts
- Create and save profiles to easily switch between different configurations
- Enable streaming to see model responses as they're generated
- Use the evaluation feature to compare responses across multiple models
- Download new models directly from the "Model Management" tab
- Set a default profile to automatically load your preferred settings on startup
- Use the "Stop Inference" button to cancel generation if it's taking too long
- Enable "Remove think blocks" to clean up thought process markers in outputs

## Troubleshooting

- If no models appear, make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve` in terminal)
- If responses take too long, try using fewer models at once or reduce the complexity of your prompt. This is largely hardware based.
- If you get errors, check that your Ollama API is accessible at http://localhost:11434
- Check the "Debug Information" expander after running a comparison to see detailed logs
- If models from your profile aren't visible, they might need to be downloaded first
